# Perceptron
A perceptron is a simple model of a biological neuron in an artificial neural network. Perceptron is also the name of an early algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               

The perceptron algorithm was designed to classify visual inputs, categorizing subjects into one of two types and separating groups with a line. Classification is an important part of machine learning and image processing. Machine learning algorithms find and classify patterns by many different means. The perceptron algorithm classifies patterns and groups by finding the linear separation between different objects and patterns that are received through numeric or visual input.
